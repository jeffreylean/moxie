## Introduction

**Moxie** is an animation editor built on top of
[MotionGfx](https://github.com/voxell-tech/motiongfx), a backend
agnostic motion graphics framework. We often call it the "LEGO for
animation".

### Why Moxie exists

We want creating and editing animations to be extremely simple. In
Moxie you build an animation by arranging action blocks, and you edit
it by moving those blocks around. Action blocks also work well with
touch input, so editing on touch screens like tablets is one of our
main focuses.

### Workspace

| Crate | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| [`moxie`](https://github.com/voxell-tech/moxie/tree/main/crates/moxie) | The editor app. |
| [`moxie_ui`](https://github.com/voxell-tech/moxie/tree/main/crates/moxie_ui) | Reusable `bevy_ui` widgets, docking, and theming, built on `fynix`. |
| [`moxie_asset`](https://github.com/voxell-tech/moxie/tree/main/crates/moxie_asset) | Asset-kind registry, absolute asset source, and the `.mat` loader. |

## Running

Clone with submodules, or fetch them into an existing checkout:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/voxell-tech/moxie.git
# or, in an existing checkout:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

```sh
cargo run -p moxie
```

### Agent tab

The Agent tab uses the Pi Coding Agent SDK through a local
TypeScript worker. See [agent setup](../../agent/README.md) for
building the worker, configuring providers, and packaging Node.js.
